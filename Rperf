\section {What we are computing}

We are interested in the K theory of the dg-category of perfect complexes on $\mathbb{R}perf$: 

\begin{equation}\label{firstlim}
L_{pe}(\mathbb{R}perf) = \lim_{specA\rightarrow \mathbb{R}perf}\hat{A}_{pe},
\end{equation}

where the above homotopy limit is indexed by all maps from affine derived schemes into $\mathbb{R}perf$, and $\hat{A}_{pe}$ denotes the dg-category of perfect modules over the normalization of a simplicial commutative algebra, $A$. We will always refer to objects of $\hat{A}_{pe}$ just as perfect $A$-modules and write tensor products, etc., with the normalization operation omitted. 

Applying Yoneda, we see that the data of a perfect complex, $T$, on $\mathbb{R}perf$ consists of: 

$\bullet$ for each pair, $(A,M)$, of a derived ring, $A$, and a perfect $A$-module, M, an $A$-module, $T_{(A,M)}$, and

$\bullet$ for each map of derived rings, $f: A \rightarrow B$, and each $A$-module, $M$, a quasi-isomorphism between $T_{(A,M)}\otimes_ f B$ and $T_{(B,N)}$, where $N=M \otimes_ f B$.

The above quasi-isomorphisms are required to satisfy a homotopy-coherent compatibility condition. 

Notice $\rperf$ has a canonical perfect complex, $\mathcal{E}$, defined by $\canon_{(A,M)}:=M$. Clearly, also, the tensor unit in $\lperperf$ is represented by $\mathcal{O}$, where $\mathcal{O}_{(A,M)}:=A.$

Another observation is that each $T\in \lperperf$ has a collection of "free parts." This is the collection of complexes of $k$-vector spaces, $T_{(k,C)}$, as C runs through all perfect complexes over $k$. These determine the value of $T$ on all maps $spec(A) \to \rperf$ which represent free $A$-modules. 

Of course, if each T had some kind of "rank $n$ part" or "Euler-characteristic n" part for each integer, $n$, and such a $T$ was determined by these modules for each n, then the K theory of our category would be much easier to compute. 

\section{Two failed approaches}

So a natural approach to this problem, hinted at above, is to look for an exhaustive set of terminal objects of subcategories of the category of affine derived schemes over $\rperf$, which indexes (\ref{firstlim}). For example, the subcategory of free modules has the collection of terminal objects indexed by all perfect complexes over the ground field, $k$. 

I mostly have not found a satisfactory collection of such terminal objects. I think doing so would amount to finding derived grassmanians which are affine, and I don't think this can be done. 

Some of my attempts at doing this lead me to the construction of the cotangent complex of a ring map and the hueristic in section 4 of these notes. 

More recently, returning to this topic has led me to the categories of section 5. 

Another approach is to try to find constraints on objects of $\lperperf$ coming from the gluing condition for sheaves on $\rperf$. An example lemma which would offer such a constraint would be that: for any $T\in\lperperf,$ for all $A\in k- sCalg$ and $A$-modules, $M$, there must be a map over $\rperf$ between $M:specA \to \rperf$ and $T_{(A,M)}:specA\to\rperf$. 

Such constraints, were I to find any, would most likely suggest a presentation of $\rperf$ as a groupoid quotient. So far I haven't really found any such constraints. 

A lot of my attempts in this area have been inspired by the following observations from a paper on shifted symplectic structures. 

\section{Useful observations of Pantev et. al}

Pantev, Toen, Vaquie, and Vezzosi make the following observations about RPerf in their Shifted Symplectic Structures article:

$\bullet$ If we let $$\cala := \mathbb{R}Hom(\canon,\canon) \simeq \canon \otimes \canon^{\wedge}$$ be the endomorphism complex over $\rperf$ of the canonical complex, $\canon,$ then the group stack, $GL_{1}(\cala),$ over $\rperf$ is canonically isomorphic over $\rperf$ to the derived loop stack, $$\mathcal{L}\rperf:=Map_{D^-St_k}(S^{1},\rperf)\to\rperf.$$

(This equivalence comes from viewing $S^1$ as $B\mathbb{Z}$ and noting that a map $B\mathbb{Z}\to\rperf$ picks out a module and an automorphism of that module.)

$\bullet$ The authors then show that the tangent complex, $\mathbb{T}_{\rperf}$,is equivalent to $\cala[1],$ and that

$\bullet$ there is a nondegenerate two form: $$\tperf\wedge\tperf \simeq Sym^2 [2](\cala) \to \mathcal{O} [2]$$

defined by a shift by 2 of: $$\cala\otimes\cala \to \cala \to \mathcal{O},$$

where the first map is multiplication and the second map is evaluation (aka trace). 


$\bullet$ The above endows $\rperf$ with a 2-shifted symplectic structure. 


\section{The general situation, $L_{pe}(M_{C})$, and a heuristic that may be helpful}

If we let $$M_{\_}:Ho(dg-Cat^{op})\to D^{-}St_{k}$$

denote Toen and Vaquie's Moduli of objects functor, then $M_{\_}$ has a left adjoint, $L_{pe}$, taking a stack to it's $dg$-category of perfect complexes. Hence we can construct the standard resolution $X_{C}\to C$:

\begin{equation}\label{resolution}
(X_{C})_{n} = (L_{pe}\circ M_{\_})^{\circ(n+1)}.
\end{equation}

We also have that, for a saturated $C,$ $M_{C}(k)$ is a classifying space for pseudo-perfect $C^{op}$ modules (those modules which are object-wise quasi-isomorphic to perfect complexes of k-modules). The group completion of this space should look like $\Omega^{\infty}K(C)$. 

It is for this reason that I believe I may be able to write the $K$-theory of $\lpemc$ as the first stage in some simplicial resolution of K(C). 

\section{Tensor classes}

Upon returning to an attempt to simplify the indexing category of (\ref{firstlim}) discussed in section 2 above, I am led to consider the following categories. 

Given a dg-commutative-algebra, $A$, and a perfect $A$-module, $P$, we construct two classical 1-categories, which may be enhanced to dg-categories: the \emph{positive} and \emph{negative tensor class} of $(A,P)$. Let $Cl^+_{A}(P)$ be the category whose objects are tuples $(B,U,f,\phi)$, with $B$ another dg-commutative-algebra, $U$, a perfect $B$ module, $f:A \rightarrow B$, a dg-algebra homomorphism, and $\phi$ a $B$-module equivalence: $$U\simeq P \otimes _{f}B.$$ Maps in this 1-category are the natural ones to define, requiring commutativity data. (It is obviously more natural to consider the dg version of this category.) Dually, we have the 1-category, $Cl^{-}_{A}(P)$, whose objects are tuples $(C,V,g,\psi)$, in which $g:C \rightarrow A$, and $\psi$ is an $A$-module equivalence: $$P\simeq V \otimes_{g}A.$$


When considering the value of a sheaf, $\mathcal{F}$, on $\rperf$, at a map $P:specA \rightarrow \rperf ,$ these categories dictate how and for which maps $Q:specB \rightarrow \rperf$ the value of $\mathcal{F}$ on $P$ is constrained by its value on $Q$. 

For example, the $A$-module, $\mathcal{F}_{P}$, carries an action by another dg-ring constructed as follows. 

First observe that if we take two objects


\section{Tannakian vs. Derived-Algebraic geometry}

I come back again and again to one philosophical point. Toen and Vaquie's moduli stack of objects, for a symmetric monoidal, linear $\infty$-category $T$, "is" $specT$ in Tannakian Geometry (really $spec(Perf(T))$). This is a statement I still need to make precise, as stacks in tannakian geometry are far more general objects than derived stacks, and I do not know how well behaved the "truncation" functor is, and how it behaves in relation to the functors $QCoh$ and $L_{pe}$. 


Tannakian geometry is the the stack theory in which the category of affine stacks is taken to be opposite to the $\infty$-category of symmetric monoidal, linear $\infty$-categories. What I have read about the theory (aside from as a specification of Toen and Vezzozi's general theory) has all been in the section 6 crash course of Hoyois, Scherotzke, and Sibilla's paper on traces, noncommutatve motives and categorified chern characters. 


From this standpoint, the K theory of the stack $specT$ should be related to categories enriched over T. There is a clear increase in "categorical level." It gives me hope to compute the K theory of such a stack in terms of secondary K theory, or even iterated K theory. 


\section{Secondary K theory and Iterated K Theory}

Secondary $K$-theory, an idea first floated by Toen. It is a version of algebraic K theory that replaces projective modules over a ring with smooth, proper, triangulated categories linear over that ring. The global version has been defined differently in different sources, but all definitions involve categorical sheaves on stacks, i.e. sheaves of dg-categories. 


Iterated K theory, especially as it relates to secondary K theory is mentioned in Hoyois, Scherotzke, and Sibilla. Iterated K theory of the complex topological K theory spectrum is studied in a paper by Lind, Sati, and Westerland. 


\section{Is $L_{pe} (M_{-})$ an additive invariant?}

I got bogged down trying to prove even that $L_{pe} (M_{-})$ commutes with filtered colimits. Nick Rozenblyum has a small note I found recently on filtered colimits of $\infty$-categories that will hopefully be helpful.
